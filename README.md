A work in progress

Play media content from a blog as a stream.

Example, paste one of the following into the 'blog url' prompt:
* http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2015/09/03/22809715/beyond-these-boots-are-made-for-walkinlee-hazlewoods-10-best-songs
* http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2015/08/27/22758202/10-great-tracks-pitchfork-left-out-of-its-best-songs-of-the-80s-list

The hope is that when reading a music blog, the content will be playable as a playlist,
regardless of the source of the content (youtube, soundcloud...).  Currently
only youtube is supported (boo!) and things are very ugly (yay!)

More info to come.
